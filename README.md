# Popular Movies - Stage 1

## Project Summary
Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, you’ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.

## Stage 1: Main Discovery Screen, A Details View, and Settings


### User Experience

In this stage you’ll build the core experience of your movies app.

Your app will:

-   Upon launch, present the user with an grid arrangement of movie posters.
-   Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:

-   The sort order can be by most popular, or by top rated

-   Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:

-   original title
-   movie poster image thumbnail
-   A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
-   user rating (called vote_average in the api)
-   release date
